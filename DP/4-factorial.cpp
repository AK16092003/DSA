/*
approach 1
- it's a simple recursion approach
- factorial is the product of all integers between n and 1
- the expression will be n!=n*(n-1)!
- the base cases are:
          0! = 1
          1! = 1
- T.C. : O(2^N)
- S.C. : O(N)

/*
- approach 2 => memoiation or Top Down
- recursive approach had a shortcoming that it called same func multiple times
- to reduce that overhead, we store the result in a dp array
- so to use dp array, we create a dp array of n+1 index to store 0-n elements and initialize them with -1
- Start with a recursive function and add a table that maps the functionâ€™s input values to the results returned by the function. Then if this function is called twice with the same parameters, we simply look up the answer in the table.
- T.C. : O(N)
- S.C. : O(N)+O(N)
*/

/*
approach 3 => Tabulation or Bottom Up
- With memoization we were still having recursive stack which was increasing the space complexity
- this also uses dp array initialized with -1 but instead of recursion, we use a loop
- pre define the base cases, start with lower values of input and keep building the solutions for higher values
- T.C. : O(N)
- S.C. : O(N)
